## 🏗️ **System Design Requirements**

### 1. **Scalability** 📈

The platform must handle **10,000 requests per second**, ensuring **high availability** for 50 million users and 100,000 drivers. Achieving this requires:

- **Load Balancing** 🖥️: Smart load balancers distribute user requests evenly across servers.
- **Horizontal Scaling** 🏗️: Increase server capacity by adding more machines to handle surges in user activity.
- **Caching Systems** 🛑: Quick responses with low latency using caching layers for common queries.

### 2. **Real-Time GPS Tracking** 📍

Handling **thousands of users** tracking vehicles in real-time is a challenge. Here's how to manage it:

- **Efficient Data Streaming** 📡: Use WebSockets or server-sent events for instant updates on driver location.
- **Data Compression** 📦: Minimize GPS data size to avoid overloading the network.

### 3. **Database Design** 💽

A robust database schema is crucial for managing users, drivers, bookings, and vehicle data.

- **Sharding** 🧩: Distribute data across multiple databases to handle massive traffic and optimize reads/writes.
- **NoSQL + SQL Combination** 🔄: For flexibility, use a NoSQL database for real-time location tracking and a SQL database for structured data like bookings.
- **Consistency & Performance** ⚡: Ensure data consistency with strong ACID principles while optimizing for high-frequency updates.

### 4. **Matching Algorithm** ⚖️

To efficiently assign drivers to users based on proximity, vehicle type, and availability, use:

- **Priority Queues** 🔁: Drivers close to a user’s location are prioritized.
- **Dynamic Matching** 🚥: If no driver is available, the system expands the search radius dynamically.
- **Load-aware Scheduling** 📊: Assign jobs while factoring in driver fatigue, route difficulty, and job history.

### 5. **Pricing Model** 💵

Dynamic pricing takes into account multiple variables such as:

- **Distance & Time** ⏳: Longer trips and congested routes have higher fares.
- **Vehicle Size** 🚛: Larger vehicles, designed for heavier cargo, will have higher rates.
- **Demand Fluctuation (Surge Pricing)** 📈: Prices increase when demand surpasses supply during peak hours or in high-demand regions.

---

## 🌟 **Bonus Features**

- **Future Scheduling** 🗓️  
  Users can book future trips by selecting a specific date and time. Implementing this would require scheduling mechanisms and reserving vehicle capacity for future trips, adding complexity to the booking and matching systems.

---

Admins can use **AirCario**'s built-in analytics to monitor the following:

- **Number of completed trips** 🚗: Track how many trips are completed daily/weekly.
